# Shorten URL API - URL Shortening Tool

Users input a link, and the API will shorten it and return a code consisting of 6 characters (numbers and letters).

Each time a user visits a previously created shortened URL, information about the user's access will be recorded, including IP address, browser, device, and time.

The application provides statistics on the number of times each shortened URL has been used.
